This game project was part of my assessment in university. It was also my first encounter with game development and Object-Oriented Design, introducing me to SOLID principles and the importance of design for scalability and flexibility.

The assignment was structured in three parts, simulating real-life project development with evolving client needs. Constraints included not modifying the game engine, minimizing downcasting, and adhering to SOLID principles with a justified design rationale.

**Game Objective:**

As the player, you must protect the village in the Wild where you initially spawn. Victory is achieved by eradicating all zombies and enemies, while failure occurs if all humans in the village are turned into zombies. Mambo Marie, a Voodoo priestess boss will keep spawning zombies if her grave is not destroyed. Stop her now!

Game Objective: As the player, you must protect the village in the Wild where you initially spawn. Victory is achieved by eradicating all zombies and enemies, while failure occurs if all humans in the village are turned into zombies. Mambo Marie, a Voodoo priestess boss will keep spawning zombies if her grave is not destroyed. Stop her now!

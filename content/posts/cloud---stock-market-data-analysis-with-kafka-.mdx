### Stock Market Data Analysis with Kafka

**Overview:**
Developed a system utilizing Apache Kafka on AWS EC2 to simulate and analyze real-time stock market data streams. This setup integrates various AWS services to ensure efficient data processing, storage, and querying.

**Architecture:**

1. **Producer**:
   * **Stock Market App Simulation**: Generates and simulates real-time stock market data.
   * **SDK Boto3**: Utilized for interfacing with AWS services.
   * **Apache Kafka**: Acts as the backbone for streaming the data. Producers publish the generated data into Kafka topics, hosted on an EC2 instance.
2. **Consumer**:
   * **Amazon S3**: Consumers read the streamed data from Kafka and store it in Amazon S3 for persistent storage.
   * **AWS Glue**: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. The Glue Crawler scans the data stored in S3 and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog with the schema and metadata.
3. **Data Processing & Analysis**:
   * **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: Centralized metadata repository to hold the schema information, making it easy to query and analyze data.
   * **Amazon Athena**: Provides serverless SQL querying capabilities on the data stored in Amazon S3. Athena utilizes the metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog for efficient data querying and analysis.

**Workflow:**

1. The **Producer** component simulates real-time stock market data using a stock market app.
2. The data is sent to Kafka topics via **Apache Kafka** producers running on AWS EC2.
3. Kafka **Consumers** then read this streamed data and store it in **Amazon S3** buckets.
4. **AWS Glue** crawlers process the data stored in S3, updating the **Glue Data Catalog** with the necessary schema information.
5. Using **Amazon Athena**, the stored data can be queried and analyzed efficiently, leveraging the metadata from the Glue Data Catalog.

**Benefits:**

* **Real-time Data Processing**: Kafka allows handling real-time data streams, making it suitable for stock market simulations and analyses.
* **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale with the volume of data, ensuring reliable performance even with large datasets.
* **Serverless Analysis**: AWS Glue and Athena provide powerful ETL and querying capabilities without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
* **Cost-efficiency**: Using serverless services like Glue and Athena helps in reducing operational costs while maintaining high efficiency.
